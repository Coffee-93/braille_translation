#### Team Members: Wesley DeLoach, Bobby Meyer, Richard Tran

## Problem Statement
* Traditional advertising typically expresses information about an upcoming event through visual media, either through physical print like movie posters and flyers or digital advertising like marketing emails. 

* This form of communication is not always accessible for those who have disabilities like the visually impaired or both visually and hearing impaired.

* By using the application for marketing purposes, event organizers, marketing professionals, student organizations, etc. can ensure both accessibility of information for all and help with compliance of ADA (Americans with Disabilities Act) standards.
